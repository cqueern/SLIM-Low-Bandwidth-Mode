# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent stable release of SLIMPress is considered supported.
Users are encouraged to update promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SLIMPress, please report it
privately.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### Preferred reporting method

Use GitHub’s **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature:

1. Navigate to the SLIMPress repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Security** tab
3. Select **Report a vulnerability**

This report will be visible only to the project maintainer.

## Disclosure Process

- Reports will be reviewed at the maintainer’s discretion
- Valid issues may be fixed in a future release
- Public disclosure may occur after a fix is available, if appropriate

There is no guaranteed response time or service-level agreement.

## Privacy

SLIMPress does not collect telemetry, analytics, crash reports,
or personal data.

Security reports are handled manually and are not stored,
tracked, or analyzed beyond what is necessary to assess the issue.
